Crate a new Shared Project            : Asteroids.Shared

In the UWP project
------------------
  - Add a reference to the Shared Project
  - add a NuGet reference to 'MonoGame.Framework.WindowsUniversal'
  - Change the 'Assembly Name' and 'Default namespace'  to Game1

    Create a Shared Project "GameContent"
    just like any monogame project, add a "Content" folder , add the mgcb file and the asset files. Using the property panel, set any file that needs to be copied to the output folder to "Copy If Newer"
    As mentionned above make sure the Content.mgcb file is set the build action to "MonogameContentReference "
    From your regular C# projects, "Add Reference...", then you'll see a Tab "Shared Project" and select the "GameContent" project.
